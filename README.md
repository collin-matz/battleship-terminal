  "You sunk my battleship!"
</p>

<p align="center">
The classic table top board game "Battleship" built entirely to run in the terminal with Rust.
</p>

<br>

<h3 align="center">How to play</h3>
<p align="center">
The correct version of Rust and Cargo must be installed on your machine before playing. There are two ways to play after this is accomplished:
</p>

<ol align="center">
    <li>Clone this repository and run the command "cargo run" in the root directory. This will boot up the game in whatever terminal you ran the command in.</li>
    <li>Download the `battleship.exe` file from the repository and double click that. This will open your machine's default browser and begin the game.</li>
</ol>
