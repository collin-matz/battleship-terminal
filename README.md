<h3><u>How to play</u></h3>
The correct version of Rust and Cargo must be installed on your machine before playing. There are two ways to play after this is accomplished:
<br><br>
<ol>
1. Clone this repository and run the command "cargo run" in the root directory. This will boot up the game in whatever terminal you ran the command in.

2. Download the `battleship.exe` file from the repository and double click that. This will open your machine's default browser and begin the game.
